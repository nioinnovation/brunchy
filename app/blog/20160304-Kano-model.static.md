I like to keep the Kano model in mind when designing. Especially when deciding which features will give the most bang for the buck.

The Kano model compares the level of feature implementation to a user’s satisfaction with the product.

Features are divided into three categories:
 - basic must haves
 - features that reliably improve performance
 - features that add extra, unexpected value

With basic, must have features, you can only lose. You must have these features and they must be fully functional. You don’t gain much in satisfaction, but you don’t lose either. Without these features, you will lose satisfaction.

For features that reliably improve performance, the time you put in is roughly equivalent to the amount of satisfaction a customer gets out.

For features that offer extra, unexpected value, the added satisfaction can be much greater than the time put in. This is the place where you get the most bang for you buck.

**TL;DR**

Once the basic features are in place and functioning well, as you improve you performance and user experience in straightforward ways, also look for areas where you can offer unexpected value. A little bit of attention given to one of these “extra” areas can skyrocket user satisfaction from average to high: a good investment.
