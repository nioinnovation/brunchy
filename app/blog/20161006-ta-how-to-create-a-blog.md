##Build it with GitHub
** Instructions and helpful links are below for those who aren't savvy with GitHub*

###Step 1
Clone the design-blog project from GitHub into your workspace and create a new branch named with your initials and blog post title
###Step 2
Open the design-blog project in your favorite text editor. In the blog folder create a new markdown file (.md) with the naming convention: 
YYYYMMDD-this-is-your-blog-name
###Step 3
Copy the header from another blog post all the way down to the three red dashes. Fill the header out with your info. Pieces of this header are important and if not filled out right, will not allow your blog to post correctly.
###Step 4
You're ready to write a blog! You can just go ahead and type, but if you want to format anything you will need to use markdown syntax. 

##Handy Helpers!
Here's some fun little helpers to get you on your way:

Markdown Syntax Cheatsheet

Markdown In-Browser WYSIWYG Editors
(just in case you don't want to work in a text editor)
https://stackedit.io/
**Note- if you use this editor, do not use the fancy formatting buttons at the top. it will not provide proper markdown characters even on exporting. You will still need to know and write the syntax. But it is awfully pretty to use!

This one seems nice but I've never used it. There's a lot out there so feel free to find your favorite!

##Not Savvy with GitHub?
Maybe GitHub, Terminal and Text Editors aren't your thing? Go ahead and use an online editor and provide the file to someone on the dev teamâ€”we can help you go over it and post it!
