In a recent brainstorm with the front-end team, there was a conversation around what differentiates [n.io](https://n.io/) and how can we illustrate all that n.io can do in a single demo.

## what makes n.io different?

n.io is:

* A real-time processing of signals in a real-time system
* A distributed, resilient system
* A platform for data processing, we don't store the processed data
* An autonomous, distributed network of nodes that can make decisions
* Subconscious of a larger system
* A service that can run on any system
* A processor that acts as close to the source as possible
* A facilitator for bidirectional communication
* Able to mitigate damage when something goes wrong in the system

## what does n.io allow the user to do?

* Manage and write services without touching code
* Process and analyze data without needing a technical background
* Rely on n.io to make decisions based on block logic without user intervention

## what do we want to demo?

We want future demos to be both passive and interactive. In other words, we would like to incorporate a visualization for audiences of any size to observe n.io as well as an interactive portion that allows the audience to experience n.io. Ideally, any demo would highlight the following features of n.io:

* interoperability (throughput)
* real-time vs. database
* embeddable
* peer-to-peer communication

* ThingWorx
* Flowhub
* flowthings.io
* Netbeast
* Kaa
* Node-RED
* ThingsSquare
* thethings.iO
