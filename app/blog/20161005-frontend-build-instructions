## Install your favorite shell script and text editor!
Feel free to use whichever terminal shell and text editor you work with best.

Recommendations:
1. Shell script: zsh/oh-my-zsh
This shell allows you to theme, has helpful plug-ins and shows you which branch you are on.

2. Text editor: Sublime Text, Atom
Patrick will probably supply you with sublime… but here’s the link just in case

## Let’s Install Homebrew!
http://brew.sh/index.html

Paste this into your terminal:

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`


## Let’s Install Node.js!
https://nodejs.org/en/

Now that you have Homebrew all you have to do is type in the terminal:

`brew install node`

## Let’s Get Synced with GitHub!
###Generate your ssh key
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/
1. See if you already have an ssh key by typing in terminal: ls -al ~/.ssh
Generate a new key by typing: 
`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com". `
2. Press Enter to accept default location
3. Choose and enter a passphrase
###Add your ssh key to the agent 
1. Make sure ssh agent is enabled by typing: 
	`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

2. Add ssh key to the agent by typing: 
	`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

### Copy Key to GitHub Account
1. Copy key to clipboard by typing:

## Let’s Install Brunch!
http://brunch.io/
1. Type in the console: 
`npm install -g brunch`

**Potential pitfalls: If you have issues installing brunch, try uninstalling node and reinstalling it. If you don’t seem to have all the dependencies you need, delete the node_modules folder and reinstall npm*


##Make Your Workspace!
1. In the console at the root: `mkdir workspace`
2. Copy project link in GitHub then open your terminal and type:
`git clone <paste-project-link> <desired-directory-name> `
3. Navigate into project directory 
4. Run brunch from your project in your workspace with:
`brunch watch --server` 

Navigate in your browser to localhost:8080 and your project should be visually up!
