The first thing I noticed was the contrast of the red n.io logo against the bright yellow wall. The vibrant color brought the logo to life. Yellow seemed daring, unexpected, but it worked.

The sky blue walls provided a fresh, happy complement to this sunny yellow. Doug does not like green, I was warned. The names “yellow conference room” and “blue conference room” reinforced the theme.

I saw panels with sensors displayed like modern art on the walls, framed in red electrical tape. Framed much like the nio logo. And then the huge, upbeat, yellow recliners sitting proudly, bold, like something right out of Dick Tracy.

Simple, bold, daring, energetic. That’s what I saw in the n.io brand.
