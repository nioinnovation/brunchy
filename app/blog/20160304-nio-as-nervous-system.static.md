Nio as the nervous system of the connected world.

Here is a nice illustration of the senses (using icons) that talks about how our bodies process incoming information.

There are tons of signals, but only a small fraction are consciously processed. Evolution has taught our bodies what is relevant and what can be ignored.

That reminds me of the ecosystem of nio. How what goes in doesn’t necessarily have to come out. Much of it gets filtered or reduced to it’s salient parts. Nio is like the brain and the backbone, the nervous system of the connected world.
