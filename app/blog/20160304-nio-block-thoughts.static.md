“Nio blocks.” I like it. That, combined with the red logo and yellow and blue walls makes me think of building blocks. Elementary elements or components that can be put together and combined in different ways—a pallet—tools for modular construction.

Here is a block illustration that could apply to nio if it had names of nio blocks instead of designer's tools:

And when researching various static site generators I saw that many of them used a hexagon for their logo. Hexagons are not only the natural building blocks of bees, but also the outline of a cube in perspective, like this:

Patrick has this block illustration on his laptop:
